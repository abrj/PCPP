Yes the produced result is correct

10.2.3 See TestStmHistogram.java

10.2.4 See TestStmHistogram.java

10.2.5 See TestStmHistogram.java

10.2.6 See TestStmHistogram.java.
The result is corrected, since is produced the same list as is 10.2.2 for total and the old histogram is empty

10.2.7 
We expect the end result of total to be empty. The method starts by reading and set the value, and then it uses getAndClear() to clear the values, which leads to a produced result of 0.
