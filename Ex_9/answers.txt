The checks performed at E7 and D5 are in some way useful, since a second thread could modify the state of the queue between the instantiantion and the checks. The checks therefore helps to ensure that the queue is not in a intermediate state before perfoming the CAS operation.
No, we do not agree the with argument due to the explanation above

12.2.2
Yes, it passes

12.2.3
Yes, it passes.

12.2.4
Yes, it passes. This does however not prove that the checks are not needed, only that there are not needed in the particular instance. This could be tested by altering the tests input and running them at different types of hardware
